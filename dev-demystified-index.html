          <h1 id="about">What is Dev Demystified?</h1>
          <p>There are nearly 1 billion search results for online web development classes. Endless promises and options for you to boost your skills into a new career in two weeks. So why aren’t we all successful web developers?</p>
          <p>Ever read an article or do a tutorial and just can’t get a solution working? Us, too. It might not be your fault.</p>
          <p>The "curse of knowledge" means once you know something, it's hard to imagine not knowing it. So often, technical authors forget their audience doesn't do what they do all day. Leaving out some critical piece of information can leave you stranded.</p>
          <p>Dev Demystified courseware is designed to quickly and safely introduce you to the most advanced concepts in programming. Each concept is introduced as a simple step from the previous one.</p>
