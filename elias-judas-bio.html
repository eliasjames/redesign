          <p>Elias Judas is an artist who works in several mediums; a writer, musician, programmer, and teacher.</p>
          <p>As a child, he lived with his grandmother, where there was little to do every night but read the big illustrated Random House dictionary page by page. By the age of six, he had eaten the fruit from the tree of knowledge of good evil, reading at a high school level.</p>
          <p>Shortly after, his parents took him to Los Angeles, where he first heard punk rock at the infamous Oki Dog on Santa Monica. He learned how to breakdance in San Diego, traveled all over Europe, including behind the "Iron Curtain" in Communist East Germany and Poland, and in Seattle caught an up and coming band called Soundgarden playing the local Bumbershoot Festival.</p>
          <p>All along, he learned math and physics from his father, a former PhD candidate, and art history and literature from his mother. After finishing high school in rural New Hampshire, he left home to find beauty and learn about the world. Stopping first in Portland, Maine, he fell in love with the architecture, culture, and the girl who would become his wife.</p>
          <p>As a journeyman programmer and working musician he lived for years in Boston, MA and Austin TX. During the day he worked at startups like Zipcar or enterprises like Charles Schwab; nights were all about music, sharing stages and rubbing shoulders with artists like The Black Angels, Reigning Sound, and Dex Romweber.</p>
          <p>Two tours as a hired gun with an established rock band, and national and international engagements as an instructor teaching programming for Fortune 500 companies completed Elias' education. In 2017 he and his wife packed up their two rescue dogs and drove back to Maine, buying a hundred year old house and renewing bonds with old friends and family.</p>
          <p>In 2020, Elias rededicates himself to his practice of constant reinvention. He starts a business called Dev Demystified, teaching programming to the general public; launches a fresh writing initiative; and writes and records new music.</p>
          <p>Elias appreciates you taking the time to read this third person bio he wrote, hopes you enjoy his other work, and looks forward to crossing paths with you in the future.</p>
